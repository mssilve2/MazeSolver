# MazeSolver
Java project that builds and solves mazes

Maze Builder and Solver

This program generates an R by C randomized maze and solves it using breadth-first search
and depth-first search to solve it, printing out the unsolved maze followed by
the partial and complete solutions for each search

Run with the command java maze.java "R" "C"

with R being the number of rows and C being the number of columns. If neither are given,
a default maze of 20x20 will be generated
